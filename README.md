Calculator For Estimating Nutrition Needs In The Oncology Population

As a dietitian that works with a very specific population of cancer patients, I estimate my patient's nutrition needs as a 
part of my nutrition assessment on a daily basis. I currently determine each component of a patient's nutrition needs "manually" 
with a regular calculator and provide my estimations in the form of a statement for clinical documentation. In order to practice more of 
my python skills, I've attempted to create a custom calculator to automate my process and improve my work flow as a dietitian. 
It's not perfect and the logic behind the actual calculations are a work in progress but it works!

How to run the Nutrition Calculator
1. Make sure to have the latest verson of Python installed
2. Open the nutrition_calc.py file in this repo and select "download" or use shortcut, 'command + shift + s'
3. Open terminal and navigate to the downloads folder where the nutrition_calc.py file is saved (cd ~/Downloads)
