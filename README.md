Calculator For Estimating Nutrition Needs In The Oncology Population

This is not instructional but I give a brief description and provide context for this project.

As a dietitian that works with a very specific population of cancer patients, I estimate my patient's nutrition needes as a 
part of my nutrition assessment on a daily basis. I currently determine each component of a patient's nutrition needs "manually" 
with a regular calculator and provide my estimations in the form of a statement for clinical documentation. In order to practice more of 
my python skills, I've attempted to create a custom calculator to automate my process and improve my work flow as a dietitian. 
It's not perfect and the logic behind the actual calculations are a work in progress but it works!

I am hoping to improve this code as I learn more and understand python better.
